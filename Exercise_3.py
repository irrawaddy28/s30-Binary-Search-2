Find peak element
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, such that where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

Solution:
1. Using binary search, we can solve this using 3 cases.
    a) If mid is greater than neighboring elements, then mid is a peak.
    b) If there is a larger element on right (A[mid] < A[mid+1]), move right
    c) if there is a larger element on left (A[mid] < A[mid-1]), move left
    d) If there is a larger element on both sides, we can move on either side. eg. [1,2,1,0,5,6,4], mid = 3, A[mid] = 0. Now, A[mid]<1 and A[mid]<5

    Moving in the direction of smaller element may or may not result in a peak.
    But moving in the direction of larger element guarantees a peak.
    Hence, if we are not at a peak already, we always move in the direction of larger element.

    Time: O(log N), Space: O(1)
